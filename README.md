# Tokenized Reward System for Local Community

This project aims to create a tokenized reward system for a local community using an ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. The system rewards community members for participating in events and volunteer activities, enhancing engagement and promoting positive contributions within the community.

## Project Overview

The "Tokenized Reward System for Local Community" project incentivizes community engagement by awarding ERC-20 tokens to community members who participate in events or volunteer. An administrator manages token distribution, assigning tokens as rewards for specific contributions.

## Features

- **ERC-20 Token Contract**: A custom ERC-20 token contract to handle minting, transferring, and querying balances.
- **Admin Dashboard**: An interface for the admin to transfer tokens to community membersâ€™ wallet addresses based on their participation.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a transparent reward system.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:
1. **ERC-20 Token Contract**: Deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, this smart contract allows for token minting, transferring, and balance checking.
2. **Admin Dashboard**: A web-based interface where the admin can view participants and allocate tokens as rewards.
3. **Backend Deployment**: Hosted on Serv00.com, which supports multiple programming languages, allowing for robust back-end management.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** and **npm**: For managing dependencies.
- **Web3.js**: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Metamask**: For managing wallet interactions.
- **Ganache** (optional): For local development and testing.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment.
- **Solidity**: For writing and compiling smart contracts.
- **Truffle** or **Remix**: For contract deployment and management.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
